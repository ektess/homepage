        <h2>My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?</h2>
        <p>
            I think the feel of the internet has shifted in an abstract way over time, as we continue to be funneled into a small handful of websites. I liked the metaphors that Schwulst uses to represent the web, using a flock of birds or a school of fish (or a spiderweb) over the cloud and galaxy imagery that we see a lot. It's easy to forget that the internet is still an interconnected web that we have some ability to attach our own creations to.

            A Rant About "Technology"
        </h2>
        <p>
            I hadn't really considered how we define technology only as more modern, complex machines and we neglect the simpler technology that we have used for centuries. The tools that we use say a lot about our life - they shape the way we live, and the way we live shape the tools we make. I think it's important not to neglect the smaller, less flashy things.

        <h2>
            A Handmade Web
        </h2>
        <p>
            I like the term handmade web, and how it reminds us of the physical time and effort that goes into the creation of hand-programmed websites. Carpenter describes the atmosphere of the 90's internet as hopeful, personal, and scrappy. It can be easy to forget these kinds of websites in the modern internet.
