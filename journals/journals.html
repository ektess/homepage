                <h2>My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?</h2>
                <p>
                    I think the feel of the internet has shifted in an abstract way over time, as we continue to be funneled into a small handful of websites. I liked the metaphors that Schwulst uses to represent the web, using a flock of birds or a school of fish (or a spiderweb) over the cloud and galaxy imagery that we see a lot. It's easy to forget that the internet is still an interconnected web that we have some ability to attach our own creations to.

                <h2>
                    A Rant About "Technology"
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hadn't really considered how we define technology only as more modern, complex machines and we neglect the simpler technology that we have used for centuries. The tools that we use say a lot about our life - they shape the way we live, and the way we live shape the tools we make. I think it's important not to neglect the smaller, less flashy things.

                <h2>
                    A Handmade Web
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I like the term handmade web, and how it reminds us of the physical time and effort that goes into the creation of hand-programmed websites. Carpenter describes the atmosphere of the 90's internet as hopeful, personal, and scrappy. It can be easy to forget these kinds of websites in the modern internet.

                <h2>
                    Hello World!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I feel like we are very separated from the technology we use. Modern technology especially is made to keep the consumer as far away as possible from the workings of computers, so they can feel almost like magic, even though they were made by humans.
